## Knock, Knock! Who dat? 🇧🇷

Hey there! My name is Paulo, but you can call me @paulossa. 

I am a Software Engineer that has a focus in Web Development and have been doing it since 2013. 
Nevertheless, I have developed applications to desktop (services and apps) as well as applications targeted as embedded devices such as SmartTVs and Credit Card Machines and Biometric Readers. 

I value and promote working environments where people work together to achieve bigger goals. 
I am a big team player and I really enjoy when Software Development Processes and Methodologies
work to deliver productivity as well as a good quality of life for those involved with the creating of a new software product.
