### Hey there!

My name is Paulo, I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Computer Science](http://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/) from the
[Federal University of Campina Grande(UFCG)](https://portal.ufcg.edu.br/) and I have been working as Full-Stack developer/engineer since then. 

I also have studied at [Western Michigan University(WMU)](https://wmich.edu/) as a foreign student, after I have met the requirements of the [Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/) program. This opportunity opened my eyes to many things, made me feel more open to different cultures and ways of thinking, and made me feel empowered as an individual and student. 

~It also made me realize how much I love the cold weather :grin:~

I believe that most of us are constantly improving ourselves, our knowledge and our techniques. Speciallly when it comes to Information Technology, which is a field in constant evolution, there is always room for growth. For example, RPA and DCGANs are the next things I want to spend some time tackling with. 

Cutting to the chase, I love working in healthy teams, where people are willing to help each other to achieve the team objectives. 
Devs, QAs, PMs, POs, and so on. When everybody is doing their part, magic happens!
On top of that, a good development process that mitigates the problems that can arise and reduces the friction in development is a must. 

But time is a finite resource and even though I wanted to polish this markdown further, I will leave this for another time. :neckbeard::hourglass_flowing_sand:

Thanks for reading up to this point! See ya!
