## Continuously improving

Hello! My name is Paulo @paulossa

I have been working in the development of software applications since 2013. More can be seen in LinkedIn. 

I am a language/tool agnostic developer, although I have my preferred idioms. I have worked as a Software Developer since 2013, mostly as web developer but also for embedded devices and desktop applications. 
 
I prefer to work in teams practicing some agile methodology, ceremonies and roles. Always being adaptable to the reality of the team.
