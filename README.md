### Hey there!

My name is Paulo, I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Computer Science](http://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/) from the
[Federal University of Campina Grande(UFCG)](https://portal.ufcg.edu.br/) and I have been working as Full-Stack developer/engineer since then. 

I also have studied at [Western Michigan University(WMU)](https://wmich.edu/) as a foreign student, after I have met the requirements of the [Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/). This opportunity opened my eyes to many things, made me feel more open to different cultures and ways of thinking, and made me feel empowered as an individual and student. 

I believe that most of us are constantly improving ourselves, our knowledge and our techniques. Speciallly when it comes to Information Technology, which is a field in constant evolution, there is always room for growth. 

But time is a finite resource and even though I wanted to polish this markdown further, I will leave this for another time. :neckbeard::hourglass_flowing_sand:
