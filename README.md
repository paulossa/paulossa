### Hey there!

Hey there! 

I am a Software Engineer and I've been working with Web Development since 2013.
I'm into DIY, Scientific stuff, group games and learning new stuff. 

I value and promote working environments where people work together to achieve goals. 
I am a big team player and I really enjoy when Software Development Processes and Methodologies
work to deliver productivity as well as a good quality of life for those developing.
